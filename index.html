<h2>Matthew I. Miller</h2>

<p>I am an MD student in the laboratory of Dr. Vijaya Kolachalama at BU, where I predominantly study deep learning methods in neuroradiology. My research interests include machine learning, and image processing, as well as Bayesian statistics and causal inference for clinical settings.
Clinically, I'm hoping to pursue a career in interventional radiology. On this website, you will find personal projects of many sorts.  </p>
